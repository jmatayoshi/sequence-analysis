# Analyzing state transitions with marginal models

This repository contains a Python module for running numerical experiments that analyze state transitions in sequential data.  The paper describing this procedure can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1145/3448139.3448182).

# Requirements

The module requires a Python installation with NumPy and statsmodels.  It has been tested on Python 3.8.

# Usage

The default parameters of the `run_simulations` function execute experiment 1, while the parameters for experiment 2 are contained in the docstring.
